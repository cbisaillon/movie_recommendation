# Movie recommender
In this project, I created a movie recommendation algorithm. 

## Installation
1. Create a new conda environment: `conda create --name movie-recommendator`
2. Install the requirements: `conda install --file requirements.txt`

## Downloading the datastets
Since the datasets are quite large, I cannot include them into this repository. You can however install them easily.

The datasets can be downloaded here:

http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip

When downloaded, extract the ml-25m folder into the big_files directory at the root of the project.
